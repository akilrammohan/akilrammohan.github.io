I'm currently a member of the inaugural Summer AI Lab (SAIL) at UW-Madison, run by the N+1 institute on campus. I'm also an intern at AppFaktors, an architecture as code company where I'm working on implementing a RAG pipeline to both help generate architecture representations from company documents and answer questions about unstructured data relating to application architecture. Previously I was an undergraduate researcher at the NeuroErgonomics Lab, where I worked on the LEARNER project under Drs. Ranjana Mehta and Ronak Mohanty, aiming to improve law enforcement training using LLM-enabled conversational NPCs in immersive XR environments.
