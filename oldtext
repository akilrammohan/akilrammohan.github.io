    I just completed the inaugural <a href="https://cdis.wisc.edu/apply-to-sail-a-hands-on-ai-summer-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Summer AI Lab (SAIL)</a> program at UW-Madison, funded by OpenAI and run by the <a href="https://nplus1.wisc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">N+1 Institute</a> on campus. My team and I built an agentic AI powered news aggregator that intelligently sources news from reputable publications and handles bias. We presented to a team of local tech industry members and the director of CDIS to showcase our final project.

    I also just completed my summer internship at <a href="https://www.appfaktors.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppFaktors</a>, an architecture as code startup where I built a RAG pipeline to turn unstructured enterprise software architecture data into codified architecture representations.

    I also did data analysis for <a href="https://www.fastersmarter.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Think Fast Talk Smart</a>, a business communication podcast. I used python, pandas, and other data science tools to determine how best to grow the audience of the podcast. I ran analyses on optimal episode posting schedules, optimal episode titling, as well as general overviews of the podcast's reach and popularity.

    Previously I was an undergraduate researcher at the <a href="https://neuroergolab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NeuroErgonomics Lab</a>, where I worked on the LEARNER project under Drs. Ranjana Mehta and Ronak Mohanty, aiming to improve law enforcement training using LLM-enabled conversational NPCs in immersive XR environments. I used a wide variety of technologies including Unity/C#, python, eye trackers from Tobii and PupilLabs, and heart rate monitors.
