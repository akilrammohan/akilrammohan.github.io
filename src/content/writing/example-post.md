# Example Post

This is a placeholder post. Replace this with your actual writing.

## How to add new posts

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `src/content/writing/` directory
2. Add frontmatter with `title`, `description`, `date`, and optionally `draft`
3. Write your content in Markdown

Posts with `draft: true` will not appear in production builds.
